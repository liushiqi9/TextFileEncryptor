# TextFileEncryptor
Create password protected txt files.

You need crypto++ to compile the project.

Put Encrypter.exe and Decrypter.exe in the same folder.

Use 'cmd> Encrypter.exe path_to_txt_file' to encrypt the txt file.

A file named 'decrypter_1.exe' will be created in the same folder, it is the encrypted txt file.

Todo:
