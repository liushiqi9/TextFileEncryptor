# TextFileEncryptor
## Purpose
Create password protected txt files.

## How to use
You need crypto++ to compile the project.

Put Encryptor.exe and Decryptor.exe in the same folder.

Use 'cmd> Encryptor.exe path_to_txt_file' to encrypt the txt file.

A file named 'decryptor_1.exe' will be created in the same folder, it is the encrypted txt file.

## Future developments
