# TextFileEncryptor
## Purpose
TextFileEncryptor generates password protected exe files from existing txt files. You can use this program to protect any information you want with a password.

## How to use
You need crypto++ to compile the project.

Put Encryptor.exe and Decryptor.exe in the same folder.

Use 'cmd> Encryptor.exe path_to_txt_file' to encrypt the txt file.

A file named 'decryptor_1.exe' will be created in the same folder, it is the encrypted txt file.

When you want to read the information stored in exe files, run it and put your password into it.

## Future developments

Todo:
- GUI
- Embed Decryptor.exe into Encryptor.exe as a section
